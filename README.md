# Big-Data-Analytics-on-the-state-of-Mental-Health-Support-in-the-Technology-Industry
This project examines the state of mental health support for employees within the tech industry and how it has evolved over the years 2014 to 2019 using the survey datasets from OSMI, an organization that conducts annual surveys to generate a better understanding of how mental health is addressed within tech companies. The study followed key data science steps, including data acquisition, exploration, preprocessing, analysis, and reporting, leading to significant findings.<br>

## Technologies Used 
Various big data technologies like Machine Learning, MongoBD, Hadoop, Spark and ELK have been used to carry out effective data analysis and some valuable insights have been retrieved which have been discussed throughout the analysis report uploaded to this repository. <br>

## Problem Statement
Mental health disorders affect 990 million individuals worldwide. 
Especially, in the technology industry, people are often seemed to be dealing with mental health issues as it is the most competitive industry. According to recent statistics by Global Health Data exchange, mental health problem has been detected in 51% of tech employees and has impacted their performance by 71%. Employees usually keep their mental problems to themselves rather than seeking help as talking about mental health disorders is highly stigmatized in our society, especially in the workplace. 
Thus, I wanted to do some analysis on this matter and come up with some ideas to enhance the state of mental health support among the employees.<br>

## Key Findings
One significant finding from the analysis is that there is a considerable segment of employees that are unaware if they have access to mental health benefits. If they do have the coverage, they are unsure of the programs that are available. Additionally, employees are not confident that their anonymity will be protected if they decide to use a benefit or program to address their mental health.The project includes extensive data visualization in Jupyter notebook, complemented by in-depth discussions in the report.
